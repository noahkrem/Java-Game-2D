Tiles to make:
- Grass tile could have even less detail

1. Earth tile(s), for a path
2. Large tree?


Mechanics to implement:
- "Fade in" effect for visible light would make it less choppy
- slower player framerate when walking, compared to sprinting
- When NPC runs into wall, change direction

Map Details:
- Make multiple maps, one for inside, one for outside

Other: 
- Replace keys with lockpicks maybe?

UI: 
- Health bar could be thinner
    - Also blends into the dark background
